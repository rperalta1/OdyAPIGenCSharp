README
------
  Odyssey API Generator is an open source project for creating shared libraries based on Tyler 
  Technologies' XSD files. The purpose of the libraries is to abstract the programmer from the 
  details of XML parsing, XML marshalling or unmarshalling, web services calls to Odyssey, and
  allow the programmer to work with C# classes directly.
  
  Please refer to the "doc" directory in order to find the following documents that 
  explain how to build the shared library and how it works: BUILD_Cli.txt, and  Odyssey API 
  Library Overview.
